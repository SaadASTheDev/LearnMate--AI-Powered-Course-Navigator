# Full Project Build Guide: E-learning Recommendation System

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up the complete E-learning platform application, using all the code provided. The project includes user feedback, A/B testing, real-time interaction updates, containerization, deployment, and monitoring.

## **Step 1: Set Up Project Structure**

1. **Create the Main Project Folder**:
   - Create a directory named `elearning_recommendation_system`.
   - Inside the main folder, create the following subfolders:
     - `backend/`: Backend services implemented using Flask.
     - `frontend/`: Frontend application implemented with React and Next.js.
     - `ml_models/`: Directory for machine learning models.
     - `data/`: Directory to store training and interaction data.
     - `scripts/`: Useful scripts for data processing.
     - `kubernetes/`: Kubernetes deployment files.

2. **Initialize Git Repository**:
   - Initialize a Git repository for version control:
     ```bash
     git init
     ```

## **Step 2: Install and Set Up Backend Components**

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Create a virtual environment and install dependencies for Flask:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     pip install flask psycopg2 kafka-python prometheus_client
     ```

2. **Database Setup**:
   - **Install PostgreSQL** using Docker:
     ```bash
     docker run -d --name elearn-postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret -p 5432:5432 postgres
     ```
   - **Database Schema**: Use `pgAdmin` to create tables for `Users`, `Courses`, and `UserCourseInteractions`.

3. **Backend Scripts**:
   - Place the following backend files in the `backend/` folder:
     - `recommend.py`: The main Flask API for course recommendations.
     - `db.py`: Database connection handling.
     - `user_feedback.py`: Collects user feedback to improve the model.
     - `ab_testing.py`: Implements A/B testing with different versions of the recommendation model.
     - `kafka_producer.py` and `kafka_consumer.py`: Handles real-time interaction data using Apache Kafka.
     - `monitoring.py`: Custom Prometheus metrics to monitor API usage and health.

## **Step 3: Install and Set Up Frontend Components**

1. **Set Up Frontend Application**:
   - Create the React/Next.js application:
     ```bash
     npx create-next-app frontend
     ```
   - Navigate to the `frontend` folder and install required packages:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     npm install axios @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled react-redux redux
     ```

2. **Frontend Scripts**:
   - Add the following files in the `frontend/` folder:
     - `pages/index.js`: Dashboard to display course recommendations.
     - `store.js`: Redux store to manage application state.

## **Step 4: Train Machine Learning Models**

1. **Prepare Training Data**:
   - Run the data extraction script to save user-course interactions as CSV files in the `data/` folder.
   - Use `extract_interactions.py` to gather interaction data.

2. **Collaborative Filtering Model**:
   - Train the model using the **Surprise** library.
   - Place the training script (`train.py`) inside the `ml_models/` folder and run it to generate `model.pkl`.

## **Step 5: Real-time Interaction Handling with Kafka**

1. **Set Up Apache Kafka**:
   - Install Kafka and Zookeeper using Docker:
     ```bash
     docker run -d --name zookeeper -p 2181:2181 zookeeper
     docker run -d --name kafka -p 9092:9092 --link zookeeper wurstmeister/kafka
     ```

2. **Kafka Producer and Consumer**:
   - Use `kafka_producer.py` and `kafka_consumer.py` to handle real-time interactions. The producer sends user interaction data, and the consumer logs the data into PostgreSQL.

## **Step 6: Containerize with Docker**

1. **Create Dockerfiles**:
   - Create Dockerfiles for `backend/`, `frontend/`, and the `database` service to containerize each component.
   - Place the Dockerfiles in their respective folders.

2. **Docker Compose**:
   - Create a `docker-compose.yml` file in the root directory to manage multi-container deployment.
   - Run the following commands to build and start the containers:
     ```bash
     docker-compose build
     docker-compose up
     ```

## **Step 7: Deploy with Kubernetes**

1. **Set Up Kubernetes Cluster**:
   - Use **Minikube** for local development:
     ```bash
     minikube start
     ```

2. **Kubernetes Configuration**:
   - Place the deployment files (`backend.yaml`, `frontend.yaml`, `postgres.yaml`, `hpa.yaml`) in the `kubernetes/` folder.
   - Deploy all services:
     ```bash
     kubectl apply -f kubernetes/
     ```

## **Step 8: Implement CI/CD Pipeline for Model Retraining**

1. **Set Up Jenkins/GitHub Actions**:
   - Install Jenkins and set up the pipeline to automate model retraining (`Jenkinsfile` or `.github/workflows/model_retraining.yml`).
   - Include steps for model evaluation and redeployment if a new model performs better.

## **Step 9: User Testing and A/B Testing**

1. **User Feedback**:
   - Run the Flask service (`user_feedback.py`) to gather user feedback via `/feedback` API.

2. **A/B Testing**:
   - Deploy different versions of the model using `ab_testing.py` to experiment with different recommendation algorithms.
   - Track user engagement metrics like CTR to determine which version performs best.

## **Step 10: Logging and Monitoring**

1. **Set Up Prometheus and Grafana**:
   - Use **Prometheus** for monitoring the backend services and **Grafana** for visualizing metrics.
   - Run Prometheus and Grafana using Docker:
     ```bash
     docker run -d --name prometheus -p 9090:9090 -v $(pwd)/prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml prom/prometheus
     docker run -d --name grafana -p 3001:3000 grafana/grafana
     ```

2. **Monitor Custom Metrics**:
   - Add Prometheus metrics (`monitoring.py`) to track API usage and model recommendations.
   - Use Grafana to visualize and track system health.

## **Step 11: Final Testing and Deployment**

1. **End-to-End Testing**:
   - Test all services together to ensure that the recommendation engine works seamlessly from data collection to user feedback.

2. **Production Deployment**:
   - Use Kubernetes to scale the services based on user traffic.
   - Ensure that auto-scaling (`HPA`) is in place for the backend service.

## **Step 12: Maintenance and Updates**

1. **Regular Model Retraining**:
   - Schedule periodic retraining based on new user interactions to keep recommendations up-to-date.

2. **Monitoring and Feedback Loop**:
   - Continuously monitor system health and use user feedback to enhance the model and improve the user interface.

By following these steps, you will have a fully functional E-learning recommendation system, equipped with real-time updates, monitoring, and automated scaling capabilities to ensure a high-quality user experience.
